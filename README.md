Jupyter notebook google colab IDE House Price Prediction Project using linear regression

I'm thrilled to share the results of a recent machine learning project I've been working on! Using linear regression, we developed a model to predict house prices based on various features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset:USA-housing.csv ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions: Data preprocessing,data visualization, model training, and evaluation Results: I got a R2 score  using linear regression which is a defenitely a good score according to the the given dataset This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. I learned a lot about data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics along the way.
